/// A character-to-voice mapping for audio generation.
///
/// Maps screenplay characters to human actors and TTS voice identifiers for
/// audio generation. Voices are specified as key/value pairs where the key is
/// the provider name and the value is an array of voice identifiers.
///
/// ## Voice Resolution
///
/// The appropriate voice is selected based on the enabled TTS provider.
/// If no voice is specified for the active provider, the default voice is used.
/// When multiple voice IDs exist for a provider, the first one is used unless
/// otherwise specified.
///
/// ## Example
///
/// ```swift
/// let narrator = CastMember(
///     character: "NARRATOR",
///     actor: "Tom Stovall",
///     gender: .male,
///     voices: [
///         "apple": ["com.apple.voice.compact.en-US.Aaron"],
///         "elevenlabs": ["21m00Tcm4TlvDq8ikWAM"],
///         "voxalta": ["narrative-1"]
///     ]
/// )
/// ```
///
/// ## Multiple Voices Per Provider
///
/// When a provider supports multiple voice IDs for a character (e.g., different
/// accents or emotional styles), all are preserved during merging to prevent
/// information loss.
///
/// ## YAML Representation
///

/// cast:
///   - character: NARRATOR
